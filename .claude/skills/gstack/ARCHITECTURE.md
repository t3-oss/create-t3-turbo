# Architecture

This document explains **why** gstack is built the way it is. For setup and commands, see CLAUDE.md. For contributing, see CONTRIBUTING.md.

## The core idea

gstack gives Claude Code a persistent browser and a set of opinionated workflow skills. The browser is the hard part — everything else is Markdown.

The key insight: an AI agent interacting with a browser needs **sub-second latency** and **persistent state**. If every command cold-starts a browser, you're waiting 3-5 seconds per tool call. If the browser dies between commands, you lose cookies, tabs, and login sessions. So gstack runs a long-lived Chromium daemon that the CLI talks to over localhost HTTP.

```

First call starts everything (~3s). Every call after: ~100-200ms.

## Why Bun

Node.js would work. Bun is better here for three reasons:

1. **Compiled binaries.** `bun build --compile` produces a single ~58MB executable. No `node_modules` at runtime, no `npx`, no PATH configuration. The binary just runs. This matters because gstack installs into `~/.claude/skills/` where users don't expect to manage a Node.js project.

2. **Native SQLite.** Cookie decryption reads Chromium's SQLite cookie database directly. Bun has `new Database()` built in — no `better-sqlite3`, no native addon compilation, no gyp. One less thing that breaks on different machines.

3. **Native TypeScript.** The server runs as `bun run server.ts` during development. No compilation step, no `ts-node`, no source maps to debug. The compiled binary is for deployment; source files are for development.

4. **Built-in HTTP server.** `Bun.serve()` is fast, simple, and doesn't need Express or Fastify. The server handles ~10 routes total. A framework would be overhead.

The bottleneck is always Chromium, not the CLI or server. Bun's startup speed (~1ms for the compiled binary vs ~100ms for Node) is nice but not the reason we chose it. The compiled binary and native SQLite are.

## The daemon model

### Why not start a browser per command?

Playwright can launch Chromium in ~2-3 seconds. For a single screenshot, that's fine. For a QA session with 20+ commands, it's 40+ seconds of browser startup overhead. Worse: you lose all state between commands. Cookies, localStorage, login sessions, open tabs — all gone.

The daemon model means:

- **Persistent state.** Log in once, stay logged in. Open a tab, it stays open. localStorage persists across commands.
- **Sub-second commands.** After the first call, every command is just an HTTP POST. ~100-200ms round-trip including Chromium's work.
- **Automatic lifecycle.** The server auto-starts on first use, auto-shuts down after 30 minutes idle. No process management needed.

### State file

The server writes `.gstack/browse.json` (atomic write via tmp + rename, mode 0o600):

```json
{ "pid": 12345, "port": 34567, "token": "uuid-v4", "startedAt": "...", "binaryVersion": "abc123" }
```

The CLI reads this file to find the server. If the file is missing, stale, or the PID is dead, the CLI spawns a new server.

### Port selection

Random port between 10000-60000 (retry up to 5 on collision). This means 10 Conductor workspaces can each run their own browse daemon with zero configuration and zero port conflicts. The old approach (scanning 9400-9409) broke constantly in multi-workspace setups.

### Version auto-restart

The build writes `git rev-parse HEAD` to `browse/dist/.version`. On each CLI invocation, if the binary's version doesn't match the running server's `binaryVersion`, the CLI kills the old server and starts a new one. This prevents the "stale binary" class of bugs entirely — rebuild the binary, next command picks it up automatically.

## Security model

### Localhost only

The HTTP server binds to `localhost`, not `0.0.0.0`. It's not reachable from the network.

### Bearer token auth

Every server session generates a random UUID token, written to the state file with mode 0o600 (owner-only read). Every HTTP request must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. If the token doesn't match, the server returns 401.

This prevents other processes on the same machine from talking to your browse server. The cookie picker UI (`/cookie-picker`) and health check (`/health`) are exempt — they're localhost-only and don't execute commands.

### Cookie security

Cookies are the most sensitive data gstack handles. The design:

1. **Keychain access requires user approval.** First cookie import per browser triggers a macOS Keychain dialog. The user must click "Allow" or "Always Allow." gstack never silently accesses credentials.

2. **Decryption happens in-process.** Cookie values are decrypted in memory (PBKDF2 + AES-128-CBC), loaded into the Playwright context, and never written to disk in plaintext. The cookie picker UI never displays cookie values — only domain names and counts.

3. **Database is read-only.** gstack copies the Chromium cookie DB to a temp file (to avoid SQLite lock conflicts with the running browser) and opens it read-only. It never modifies your real browser's cookie database.

4. **Key caching is per-session.** The Keychain password + derived AES key are cached in memory for the server's lifetime. When the server shuts down (idle timeout or explicit stop), the cache is gone.

5. **No cookie values in logs.** Console, network, and dialog logs never contain cookie values. The `cookies` command outputs cookie metadata (domain, name, expiry) but values are truncated.

### Shell injection prevention

The browser registry (Comet, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge) is hardcoded. Database paths are constructed from known constants, never from user input. Keychain access uses `Bun.spawn()` with explicit argument arrays, not shell string interpolation.

## The ref system

Refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, `@c1`) are how the agent addresses page elements without writing CSS selectors or XPath.

### How it works

```
1. Agent runs: $B snapshot -i
2. Server calls Playwright's page.accessibility.snapshot()
3. Parser walks the ARIA tree, assigns sequential refs: @e1, @e2, @e3...
4. For each ref, builds a Playwright Locator: getByRole(role, { name }).nth(index)
5. Stores Map<string, RefEntry> on the BrowserManager instance (role + name + Locator)
6. Returns the annotated tree as plain text

Later:
7. Agent runs: $B click @e3
8. Server resolves @e3 → Locator → locator.click()
```

### Why Locators, not DOM mutation

The obvious approach is to inject `data-ref="@e1"` attributes into the DOM. This breaks on:

- **CSP (Content Security Policy).** Many production sites block DOM modification from scripts.
- **React/Vue/Svelte hydration.** Framework reconciliation can strip injected attributes.
- **Shadow DOM.** Can't reach inside shadow roots from the outside.

Playwright Locators are external to the DOM. They use the accessibility tree (which Chromium maintains internally) and `getByRole()` queries. No DOM mutation, no CSP issues, no framework conflicts.

### Ref lifecycle

Refs are cleared on navigation (the `framenavigated` event on the main frame). This is correct — after navigation, all locators are stale. The agent must run `snapshot` again to get fresh refs. This is by design: stale refs should fail loudly, not click the wrong element.

### Ref staleness detection

SPAs can mutate the DOM without triggering `framenavigated` (e.g. React router transitions, tab switches, modal opens). This makes refs stale even though the page URL didn't change. To catch this, `resolveRef()` performs an async `count()` check before using any ref:

```
resolveRef(@e3) → entry = refMap.get("e3")
                → count = await entry.locator.count()
                → if count === 0: throw "Ref @e3 is stale — element no longer exists. Run 'snapshot' to get fresh refs."
                → if count > 0: return { locator }
```

This fails fast (~5ms overhead) instead of letting Playwright's 30-second action timeout expire on a missing element. The `RefEntry` stores `role` and `name` metadata alongside the Locator so the error message can tell the agent what the element was.

### Cursor-interactive refs (@c)

The `-C` flag finds elements that are clickable but not in the ARIA tree — things styled with `cursor: pointer`, elements with `onclick` attributes, or custom `tabindex`. These get `@c1`, `@c2` refs in a separate namespace. This catches custom components that frameworks render as `<div>` but are actually buttons.

## Logging architecture

Three ring buffers (50,000 entries each, O(1) push):

```
Browser events → CircularBuffer (in-memory) → Async flush to .gstack/*.log
```

Console messages, network requests, and dialog events each have their own buffer. Flushing happens every 1 second — the server appends only new entries since the last flush. This means:

- HTTP request handling is never blocked by disk I/O
- Logs survive server crashes (up to 1 second of data loss)
- Memory is bounded (50K entries × 3 buffers)
- Disk files are append-only, readable by external tools

The `console`, `network`, and `dialog` commands read from the in-memory buffers, not disk. Disk files are for post-mortem debugging.

## SKILL.md template system

### The problem

SKILL.md files tell Claude how to use the browse commands. If the docs list a flag that doesn't exist, or miss a command that was added, the agent hits errors. Hand-maintained docs always drift from code.

### The solution

```
SKILL.md.tmpl          (human-written prose + placeholders)
       ↓
gen-skill-docs.ts      (reads source code metadata)
       ↓
SKILL.md               (committed, auto-generated sections)
```

Templates contain the workflows, tips, and examples that require human judgment. Placeholders are filled from source code at build time:

| Placeholder | Source | What it generates |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| `{{COMMAND_REFERENCE}}` | `commands.ts` | Categorized command table |
| `{{SNAPSHOT_FLAGS}}` | `snapshot.ts` | Flag reference with examples |
| `{{PREAMBLE}}` | `gen-skill-docs.ts` | Startup block: update check, session tracking, contributor mode, AskUserQuestion format |
| `{{BROWSE_SETUP}}` | `gen-skill-docs.ts` | Binary discovery + setup instructions |
| `{{BASE_BRANCH_DETECT}}` | `gen-skill-docs.ts` | Dynamic base branch detection for PR-targeting skills (ship, review, qa, plan-ceo-review) |
| `{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` | `gen-skill-docs.ts` | Shared QA methodology block for /qa and /qa-only |

This is structurally sound — if a command exists in code, it appears in docs. If it doesn't exist, it can't appear.

### The preamble

Every skill starts with a `{{PREAMBLE}}` block that runs before the skill's own logic. It handles four things in a single bash command:

1. **Update check** — calls `gstack-update-check`, reports if an upgrade is available.
2. **Session tracking** — touches `~/.gstack/sessions/$PPID` and counts active sessions (files modified in the last 2 hours). When 3+ sessions are running, all skills enter "ELI16 mode" — every question re-grounds the user on context because they're juggling windows.
3. **Contributor mode** — reads `gstack_contributor` from config. When true, the agent files casual field reports to `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/` when gstack itself misbehaves.
4. **AskUserQuestion format** — universal format: context, question, `RECOMMENDATION: Choose X because ___`, lettered options. Consistent across all skills.

### Why committed, not generated at runtime?

Three reasons:

1. **Claude reads SKILL.md at skill load time.** There's no build step when a user invokes `/browse`. The file must already exist and be correct.
2. **CI can validate freshness.** `gen:skill-docs --dry-run` + `git diff --exit-code` catches stale docs before merge.
3. **Git blame works.** You can see when a command was added and in which commit.

### Template test tiers

| Tier | What | Cost | Speed |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 — Static validation | Parse every `$B` command in SKILL.md, validate against registry | Free | <2s |
| 2 — E2E via `claude -p` | Spawn real Claude session, run each skill, check for errors | ~$3.85 | ~20min |
| 3 — LLM-as-judge | Sonnet scores docs on clarity/completeness/actionability | ~$0.15 | ~30s |

Tier 1 runs on every `bun test`. Tiers 2+3 are gated behind `EVALS=1`. The idea is: catch 95% of issues for free, use LLMs only for judgment calls.

## Command dispatch

Commands are categorized by side effects:

- **READ** (text, html, links, console, cookies, ...): No mutations. Safe to retry. Returns page state.
- **WRITE** (goto, click, fill, press, ...): Mutates page state. Not idempotent.
- **META** (snapshot, screenshot, tabs, chain, ...): Server-level operations that don't fit neatly into read/write.

This isn't just organizational. The server uses it for dispatch:

```typescript
if (READ_COMMANDS.has(cmd))  → handleReadCommand(cmd, args, bm)
if (WRITE_COMMANDS.has(cmd)) → handleWriteCommand(cmd, args, bm)
if (META_COMMANDS.has(cmd))  → handleMetaCommand(cmd, args, bm, shutdown)
```

The `help` command returns all three sets so agents can self-discover available commands.

## Error philosophy

Errors are for AI agents, not humans. Every error message must be actionable:

- "Element not found" → "Element not found or not interactable. Run `snapshot -i` to see available elements."
- "Selector matched multiple elements" → "Selector matched multiple elements. Use @refs from `snapshot` instead."
- Timeout → "Navigation timed out after 30s. The page may be slow or the URL may be wrong."

Playwright's native errors are rewritten through `wrapError()` to strip internal stack traces and add guidance. The agent should be able to read the error and know what to do next without human intervention.

### Crash recovery

The server doesn't try to self-heal. If Chromium crashes (`browser.on('disconnected')`), the server exits immediately. The CLI detects the dead server on the next command and auto-restarts. This is simpler and more reliable than trying to reconnect to a half-dead browser process.

## E2E test infrastructure

### Session runner (`test/helpers/session-runner.ts`)

E2E tests spawn `claude -p` as a completely independent subprocess — not via the Agent SDK, which can't nest inside Claude Code sessions. The runner:

1. Writes the prompt to a temp file (avoids shell escaping issues)
2. Spawns `sh -c 'cat prompt | claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose'`
3. Streams NDJSON from stdout for real-time progress
4. Races against a configurable timeout
5. Parses the full NDJSON transcript into structured results

The `parseNDJSON()` function is pure — no I/O, no side effects — making it independently testable.

### Observability data flow

```
  skill-e2e.test.ts
        │
        │ generates runId, passes testName + runId to each call
        │
  ┌─────┼──────────────────────────────┐

  │     │                              │
  │  per tool call:              per addTest():
  │  ┌──┼──────────┐              savePartial()
  │  │  │          │                   │

  │ [HB] [PL]    [NJ]          _partial-e2e.json
  │  │    │        │             (atomic overwrite)
  │  │    │        │
  │  ▼    ▼        ▼

  │

  │  Run dir: e2e-runs/{runId}/
  │
  │         eval-watch.ts
  │              │
  │        ┌─────┴─────┐

  │        └─────┬─────┘
  │              ▼
  │        render dashboard
  │        (stale >10min? warn)
```

**Split ownership:** session-runner owns the heartbeat (current test state), eval-store owns partial results (completed test state). The watcher reads both. Neither component knows about the other — they share data only through the filesystem.

**Non-fatal everything:** All observability I/O is wrapped in try/catch. A write failure never causes a test to fail. The tests themselves are the source of truth; observability is best-effort.

**Machine-readable diagnostics:** Each test result includes `exit_reason` (success, timeout, error_max_turns, error_api, exit_code_N), `timeout_at_turn`, and `last_tool_call`. This enables `jq` queries like:
```bash
jq '.tests[] | select(.exit_reason == "timeout") | .last_tool_call' ~/.gstack-dev/evals/_partial-e2e.json
```

### Eval persistence (`test/helpers/eval-store.ts`)

The `EvalCollector` accumulates test results and writes them in two ways:

1. **Incremental:** `savePartial()` writes `_partial-e2e.json` after each test (atomic: write `.tmp`, `fs.renameSync`). Survives kills.
2. **Final:** `finalize()` writes a timestamped eval file (e.g. `e2e-20260314-143022.json`). The partial file is never cleaned up — it persists alongside the final file for observability.

`eval:compare` diffs two eval runs. `eval:summary` aggregates stats across all runs in `~/.gstack-dev/evals/`.

### Test tiers

| Tier | What | Cost | Speed |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 — Static validation | Parse `$B` commands, validate against registry, observability unit tests | Free | <5s |
| 2 — E2E via `claude -p` | Spawn real Claude session, run each skill, scan for errors | ~$3.85 | ~20min |
| 3 — LLM-as-judge | Sonnet scores docs on clarity/completeness/actionability | ~$0.15 | ~30s |

Tier 1 runs on every `bun test`. Tiers 2+3 are gated behind `EVALS=1`. The idea: catch 95% of issues for free, use LLMs only for judgment calls and integration testing.

## What's intentionally not here

- **No WebSocket streaming.** HTTP request/response is simpler, debuggable with curl, and fast enough. Streaming would add complexity for marginal benefit.
- **No MCP protocol.** MCP adds JSON schema overhead per request and requires a persistent connection. Plain HTTP + plain text output is lighter on tokens and easier to debug.
- **No multi-user support.** One server per workspace, one user. The token auth is defense-in-depth, not multi-tenancy.
- **No Windows/Linux cookie decryption.** macOS Keychain is the only supported credential store. Linux (GNOME Keyring/kwallet) and Windows (DPAPI) are architecturally possible but not implemented.
- **No iframe support.** Playwright can handle iframes but the ref system doesn't cross frame boundaries yet. This is the most-requested missing feature.
