# gstack development

## Commands

```bash
bun install          # install dependencies
bun test             # run free tests (browse + snapshot + skill validation)
bun run test:evals   # run paid evals: LLM judge + E2E (~$4/run)
bun run test:e2e     # run E2E tests only (~$3.85/run)
bun run dev <cmd>    # run CLI in dev mode, e.g. bun run dev goto https://example.com
bun run build        # gen docs + compile binaries
bun run gen:skill-docs  # regenerate SKILL.md files from templates
bun run skill:check  # health dashboard for all skills
bun run dev:skill    # watch mode: auto-regen + validate on change
bun run eval:list    # list all eval runs from ~/.gstack-dev/evals/
bun run eval:compare # compare two eval runs (auto-picks most recent)
bun run eval:summary # aggregate stats across all eval runs
```

`test:evals` requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. E2E tests stream progress in real-time
(tool-by-tool via `--output-format stream-json --verbose`). Results are persisted
to `~/.gstack-dev/evals/` with auto-comparison against the previous run.

## SKILL.md workflow

SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. To update docs:

1. Edit the `.tmpl` file (e.g. `SKILL.md.tmpl` or `browse/SKILL.md.tmpl`)
2. Run `bun run gen:skill-docs` (or `bun run build` which does it automatically)
3. Commit both the `.tmpl` and generated `.md` files

To add a new browse command: add it to `browse/src/commands.ts` and rebuild.
To add a snapshot flag: add it to `SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` in `browse/src/snapshot.ts` and rebuild.

## Writing SKILL templates

SKILL.md.tmpl files are **prompt templates read by Claude**, not bash scripts.
Each bash code block runs in a separate shell — variables do not persist between blocks.

Rules:
- **Use natural language for logic and state.** Don't use shell variables to pass
  state between code blocks. Instead, tell Claude what to remember and reference
  it in prose (e.g., "the base branch detected in Step 0").
- **Don't hardcode branch names.** Detect `main`/`master`/etc dynamically via
  `gh pr view` or `gh repo view`. Use `{{BASE_BRANCH_DETECT}}` for PR-targeting
  skills. Use "the base branch" in prose, `<base>` in code block placeholders.
- **Keep bash blocks self-contained.** Each code block should work independently.
  If a block needs context from a previous step, restate it in the prose above.
- **Express conditionals as English.** Instead of nested `if/elif/else` in bash,
  write numbered decision steps: "1. If X, do Y. 2. Otherwise, do Z."

## Browser interaction

When you need to interact with a browser (QA, dogfooding, cookie setup), use the
`/browse` skill or run the browse binary directly via `$B <command>`. NEVER use
`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools — they are slow, unreliable, and not what this
project uses.

## Vendored symlink awareness

When developing gstack, `.claude/skills/gstack` may be a symlink back to this
working directory (gitignored). This means skill changes are **live immediately** —
great for rapid iteration, risky during big refactors where half-written skills
could break other Claude Code sessions using gstack concurrently.

**Check once per session:** Run `ls -la .claude/skills/gstack` to see if it's a
symlink or a real copy. If it's a symlink to your working directory, be aware that:
- Template changes + `bun run gen:skill-docs` immediately affect all gstack invocations
- Breaking changes to SKILL.md.tmpl files can break concurrent gstack sessions
- During large refactors, remove the symlink (`rm .claude/skills/gstack`) so the
  global install at `~/.claude/skills/gstack/` is used instead

**For plan reviews:** When reviewing plans that modify skill templates or the
gen-skill-docs pipeline, consider whether the changes should be tested in isolation
before going live (especially if the user is actively using gstack in other windows).

## CHANGELOG style

CHANGELOG.md is **for users**, not contributors. Write it like product release notes:

- Lead with what the user can now **do** that they couldn't before. Sell the feature.
- Use plain language, not implementation details. "You can now..." not "Refactored the..."
- Put contributor/internal changes in a separate "For contributors" section at the bottom.
- Every entry should make someone think "oh nice, I want to try that."
- No jargon: say "every question now tells you which project and branch you're in" not
  "AskUserQuestion format standardized across skill templates via preamble resolver."

## E2E eval failure blame protocol

When an E2E eval fails during `/ship` or any other workflow, **never claim "not
related to our changes" without proving it.** These systems have invisible couplings —
a preamble text change affects agent behavior, a new helper changes timing, a
regenerated SKILL.md shifts prompt context.

**Required before attributing a failure to "pre-existing":**
1. Run the same eval on main (or base branch) and show it fails there too
2. If it passes on main but fails on the branch — it IS your change. Trace the blame.
3. If you can't run on main, say "unverified — may or may not be related" and flag it
   as a risk in the PR body

"Pre-existing" without receipts is a lazy claim. Prove it or don't say it.

## Deploying to the active skill

The active skill lives at `~/.claude/skills/gstack/`. After making changes:

1. Push your branch
2. Fetch and reset in the skill directory: `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`
3. Rebuild: `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && bun run build`

Or copy the binary directly: `cp browse/dist/browse ~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse`
