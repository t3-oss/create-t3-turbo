# TODOS

## Browse

### Bundle server.ts into compiled binary

**What:** Eliminate `resolveServerScript()` fallback chain entirely — bundle server.ts into the compiled browse binary.

**Why:** The current fallback chain (check adjacent to cli.ts, check global install) is fragile and caused bugs in v0.3.2. A single compiled binary is simpler and more reliable.

**Context:** Bun's `--compile` flag can bundle multiple entry points. The server is currently resolved at runtime via file path lookup. Bundling it removes the resolution step entirely.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Sessions (isolated browser instances)

**What:** Isolated browser instances with separate cookies/storage/history, addressable by name.

**Why:** Enables parallel testing of different user roles, A/B test verification, and clean auth state management.

**Context:** Requires Playwright browser context isolation. Each session gets its own context with independent cookies/localStorage. Prerequisite for video recording (clean context lifecycle) and auth vault.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3

### Video recording

**What:** Record browser interactions as video (start/stop controls).

**Why:** Video evidence in QA reports and PR bodies. Currently deferred because `recreateContext()` destroys page state.

**Context:** Needs sessions for clean context lifecycle. Playwright supports video recording per context. Also needs WebM → GIF conversion for PR embedding.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions

### v20 encryption format support

**What:** AES-256-GCM support for future Chromium cookie DB versions (currently v10).

**Why:** Future Chromium versions may change encryption format. Proactive support prevents breakage.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### State persistence

**What:** Save/load cookies + localStorage to JSON files for reproducible test sessions.

**Why:** Enables "resume where I left off" for QA sessions and repeatable auth states.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions

### Auth vault

**What:** Encrypted credential storage, referenced by name. LLM never sees passwords.

**Why:** Security — currently auth credentials flow through the LLM context. Vault keeps secrets out of the AI's view.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions, state persistence

### Iframe support

**What:** `frame <sel>` and `frame main` commands for cross-frame interaction.

**Why:** Many web apps use iframes (embeds, payment forms, ads). Currently invisible to browse.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Semantic locators

**What:** `find role/label/text/placeholder/testid` with attached actions.

**Why:** More resilient element selection than CSS selectors or ref numbers.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Device emulation presets

**What:** `set device "iPhone 16 Pro"` for mobile/tablet testing.

**Why:** Responsive layout testing without manual viewport resizing.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Network mocking/routing

**What:** Intercept, block, and mock network requests.

**Why:** Test error states, loading states, and offline behavior.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Download handling

**What:** Click-to-download with path control.

**Why:** Test file download flows end-to-end.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Content safety

**What:** `--max-output` truncation, `--allowed-domains` filtering.

**Why:** Prevent context window overflow and restrict navigation to safe domains.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Streaming (WebSocket live preview)

**What:** WebSocket-based live preview for pair browsing sessions.

**Why:** Enables real-time collaboration — human watches AI browse.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4

### CDP mode

**What:** Connect to already-running Chrome/Electron apps via Chrome DevTools Protocol.

**Why:** Test production apps, Electron apps, and existing browser sessions without launching new instances.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Linux/Windows cookie decryption

**What:** GNOME Keyring / kwallet / DPAPI support for non-macOS cookie import.

**Why:** Cross-platform cookie import. Currently macOS-only (Keychain).

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4

## Ship

### Ship log — persistent record of /ship runs

**What:** Append structured JSON entry to `.gstack/ship-log.json` at end of every /ship run (version, date, branch, PR URL, review findings, Greptile stats, todos completed, test results).

**Why:** /retro has no structured data about shipping velocity. Ship log enables: PRs-per-week trending, review finding rates, Greptile signal over time, test suite growth.

**Context:** /retro already reads greptile-history.md — same pattern. Eval persistence (eval-store.ts) shows the JSON append pattern exists in the codebase. ~15 lines in ship template.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Post-deploy verification (ship + browse)

**What:** After push, browse staging/preview URL, screenshot key pages, check console for JS errors, compare staging vs prod via snapshot diff. Include verification screenshots in PR body. STOP if critical errors found.

**Why:** Catch deployment-time regressions (JS errors, broken layouts) before merge.

**Context:** Requires S3 upload infrastructure for PR screenshots. Pairs with visual PR annotations.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload, visual PR annotations

### Visual verification with screenshots in PR body

**What:** /ship Step 7.5: screenshot key pages after push, embed in PR body.

**Why:** Visual evidence in PRs. Reviewers see what changed without deploying locally.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## Review

### Inline PR annotations

**What:** /ship and /review post inline review comments at specific file:line locations using `gh api` to create pull request review comments.

**Why:** Line-level annotations are more actionable than top-level comments. The PR thread becomes a line-by-line conversation between Greptile, Claude, and human reviewers.

**Context:** GitHub supports inline review comments via `gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews`. Pairs naturally with Phase 3.6 visual annotations.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Greptile training feedback export

**What:** Aggregate greptile-history.md into machine-readable JSON summary of false positive patterns, exportable to the Greptile team for model improvement.

**Why:** Closes the feedback loop — Greptile can use FP data to stop making the same mistakes on your codebase.

**Context:** Was a P3 Future Idea. Upgraded to P2 now that greptile-history.md data infrastructure exists. The signal data is already being collected; this just makes it exportable. ~40 lines.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Enough FP data accumulated (10+ entries)

### Visual review with annotated screenshots

**What:** /review Step 4.5: browse PR's preview deploy, annotated screenshots of changed pages, compare against production, check responsive layouts, verify accessibility tree.

**Why:** Visual diff catches layout regressions that code review misses.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## QA

### QA trend tracking

**What:** Compare baseline.json over time, detect regressions across QA runs.

**Why:** Spot quality trends — is the app getting better or worse?

**Context:** QA already writes structured reports. This adds cross-run comparison.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### CI/CD QA integration

**What:** `/qa` as GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops.

**Why:** Automated quality gate in CI. Catch regressions before merge.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### Smart default QA tier

**What:** After a few runs, check index.md for user's usual tier pick, skip the AskUserQuestion.

**Why:** Reduces friction for repeat users.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### Accessibility audit mode

**What:** `--a11y` flag for focused accessibility testing.

**Why:** Dedicated accessibility testing beyond the general QA checklist.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

## Retro

### Deployment health tracking (retro + browse)

**What:** Screenshot production state, check perf metrics (page load times), count console errors across key pages, track trends over retro window.

**Why:** Retro should include production health alongside code metrics.

**Context:** Requires browse integration. Screenshots + metrics fed into retro output.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Browse sessions

## Infrastructure

### /setup-gstack-upload skill (S3 bucket)

**What:** Configure S3 bucket for image hosting. One-time setup for visual PR annotations.

**Why:** Prerequisite for visual PR annotations in /ship and /review.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### gstack-upload helper

**What:** `browse/bin/gstack-upload` — upload file to S3, return public URL.

**Why:** Shared utility for all skills that need to embed images in PRs.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

### WebM to GIF conversion

**What:** ffmpeg-based WebM → GIF conversion for video evidence in PRs.

**Why:** GitHub PR bodies render GIFs but not WebM. Needed for video recording evidence.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Video recording

### Deploy-verify skill

**What:** Lightweight post-deploy smoke test: hit key URLs, verify 200s, screenshot critical pages, console error check, compare against baseline snapshots. Pass/fail with evidence.

**Why:** Fast post-deploy confidence check, separate from full QA.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### GitHub Actions eval upload

**What:** Run eval suite in CI, upload result JSON as artifact, post summary comment on PR.

**Why:** CI integration catches quality regressions before merge and provides persistent eval records per PR.

**Context:** Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI secrets. Cost is ~$4/run. Eval persistence system (v0.3.6) writes JSON to `~/.gstack-dev/evals/` — CI would upload as GitHub Actions artifacts and use `eval:compare` to post delta comment.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Eval persistence (shipped in v0.3.6)

### E2E model pinning

**What:** Pin E2E tests to claude-sonnet-4-6 for cost efficiency, add retry:2 for flaky LLM responses.

**Why:** Reduce E2E test cost and flakiness.

**Effort:** XS
**Priority:** P2

### Eval web dashboard

**What:** `bun run eval:dashboard` serves local HTML with charts: cost trending, detection rate, pass/fail history.

**Why:** Visual charts better for spotting trends than CLI tools.

**Context:** Reads `~/.gstack-dev/evals/*.json`. ~200 lines HTML + chart.js via Bun HTTP server.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Eval persistence (shipped in v0.3.6)

### CI/CD QA quality gate

**What:** Run `/qa` as a GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops below threshold.

**Why:** Automated quality gate catches regressions before merge. Currently QA is manual — CI integration makes it part of the standard workflow.

**Context:** Requires headless browse binary available in CI. The `/qa` skill already produces `baseline.json` with health scores — CI step would compare against the main branch baseline and fail if score drops. Would need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI secrets since `/qa` uses Claude.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### CDP-based DOM mutation detection for ref staleness

**What:** Use Chrome DevTools Protocol `DOM.documentUpdated` / MutationObserver events to proactively invalidate stale refs when the DOM changes, without requiring an explicit `snapshot` call.

**Why:** Current ref staleness detection (async count() check) only catches stale refs at action time. CDP mutation detection would proactively warn when refs become stale, preventing the 5-second timeout entirely for SPA re-renders.

**Context:** Parts 1+2 of ref staleness fix (RefEntry metadata + eager validation via count()) are shipped. This is Part 3 — the most ambitious piece. Requires CDP session alongside Playwright, MutationObserver bridge, and careful performance tuning to avoid overhead on every DOM change.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Ref staleness Parts 1+2 (shipped)

## Document-Release

### Auto-invoke /document-release from /ship

**What:** Add Step 8.5 to /ship that reads document-release/SKILL.md and executes the doc update workflow after creating the PR.

**Why:** Zero-friction doc updates — user runs /ship and docs are automatically current. No extra command to remember.

**Context:** /ship currently ends at Step 8 (PR URL output). Step 8.5 would continue into the document-release workflow. Same pattern as /ship calling /review's checklist in Step 3.5.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** /document-release shipped

### `{{DOC_VOICE}}` shared resolver

**What:** Create a placeholder resolver in gen-skill-docs.ts encoding the gstack voice guide (friendly, user-forward, lead with benefits). Inject into /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5, and reference from CLAUDE.md.

**Why:** DRY — voice rules currently live inline in 3 places (CLAUDE.md CHANGELOG style section, /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5). When the voice evolves, all three drift.

**Context:** Same pattern as `{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` — shared block injected into multiple templates to prevent drift. ~20 lines in gen-skill-docs.ts.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None
