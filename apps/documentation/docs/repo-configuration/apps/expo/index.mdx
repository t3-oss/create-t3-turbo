The Expo app is set up with the following:

- React Native with React 18
- Navigation using Expo Router
- Tailwind using NativeWind
- Typesafe API calls using tRPC

import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
