# Coding Standards

This directory contains the coding standards and best practices for projects using this template.

## Structure

Each standards file covers a specific aspect of development:

- **git.md** - Git workflow and commit conventions
- **naming.md** - The naming conventions we follow

## Usage

These standards are automatically included in `CLAUDE.md` and made available to AI coding assistants working in this repository.

## Maintenance

When adding or updating standards:
1. Keep each file focused on a single topic
2. Be specific and actionable
3. Include examples where helpful
4. Update this README when adding new standards files
5. Add it to [agent-context.md](./agent-context.md)
